This is an example project that is intended to be used to search for the name of an artist and return a list of releases by that artist. The user can then click on a specific release to get more information about the release and also see stats from other Discogs users.

For local use after cloning, create a .env.local file and add a Discogs consumer key and secret in this format:

NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOGS_KEY=key
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCOGS_SECRET=secret
